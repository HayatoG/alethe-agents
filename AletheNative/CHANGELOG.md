All notable user-facing changes to Alethe for macOS (native) are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Native macOS app skeleton (Swift, macOS 26+), bundle id `com.kc1t.alethe.mac`.
- Main window with a sidebar and toolbar, a Settings window (⌘,) and UI zoom in the View menu
  (⌘+ / ⌘− / ⌘0); the zoom level and sidebar visibility are restored on relaunch.
- Sidebar with nested groups, projects and their terminals: add project folders (⌘O, the + button
  or by dropping folders from Finder), create groups (⇧⌘N), drag projects between groups or onto a
  group, move them with the context menu, show them in Finder, and undo any change with ⌘Z.
- New Project (⌘N) and New Group (⇧⌘N) sheets, plus Edit Project… / Edit Group… in the sidebar
  context menu: name, color, folder and group (or parent group); missing or already-added folders
  are reported before saving, and every edit can be undone with ⌘Z.
- Data is stored per profile in `~/Library/Application Support/com.kc1t.alethe.mac`.
